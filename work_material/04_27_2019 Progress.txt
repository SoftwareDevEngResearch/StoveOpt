4/27:
File organization:

--looking at the cylinder example for guidance--there are a lot of files
constant > polyMesh > boundary,faces,neighbour,owner,points
0 > initialconditions (pressure velocity)
dynamicCode > no idea
system > blockMeshDict, controlDict, fvSchemes, fvSolution

NEXT LEE
--walkthrough all of the files in the "constant" folder. I suspect these are the ones that are going to require the heavy lifting


Goal this week:
-create templates for all needed files
--create functions to edit files:
	1.) open file: (the path and fname  will be in the input file -- worry about this later)
	2.) seek to line for vertices (or search for the pt#i)
	3.) write over the current entries
	4.) save the file as a certain name in the blockmesh file folder
		-Needs to have a number designation, or letter for iteration purposes
	5.) close file
	

--Going with the reactionfoam for now
