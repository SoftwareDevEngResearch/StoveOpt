case:
# Usage:
# geometry_file_directory: An existing path, where directories are separated by ...
# geometry_file_name: Edited Stove_Geometry.xlsx sheet. Please include extension
# secondary_air_flow_rate: integer, or float value in units of m^3/s
# primary_air_flow_rate: integer, or float also in units of m^3/s
# max_time_step: float. Recommended 1e-3 through 1e-5 for temporal resolution
# temporal: either "STEADY" or "TRANSIENT" in all caps  WITHOUT  quotes. This chooses the solver Type
# number_intial_surrounding_cases_initial_surrounding_cases: integer. Recommend odd values between 3 and 7
# ss_tolerance: float. for iteration convergence, should be less than 1e-3. Used to terminate transient simulaitons should "steady" be selected
# OS: string. Type either "LINUX" or "WINDOWS" capitalized WITHOUT quotes
