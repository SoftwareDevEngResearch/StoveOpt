\section{Introduction and Motivation}
In recent years, numerous research studies have identified a compelling case for desiging and distributing cleaner burning biomass cookstoves for low resource communities. Household air pollution, as a product of poor combustion efficiency of existing cooking technology, can cause chronic respiratory conditionsand has been linked to nearly four million premature deaths annually [REFERNCE THE CLEAN COOKING ALLIANCE PAGE--OPEN IN BROWSER]. Additionally, using biomass as a fuel source for existing inefficient cooking technology contributes significantly to global black carbon emission, which (LC PUT SOMETHING JUICY HERE FROM BOND REPORT). Identification of the pervasive lack of clean cooking technology has led to numerous investigations regarding the improvement of existing cooking technology.

Research studies in the recent past have investigated the state of clean cooking development from social, economic, and technological perspectives. BLURB ABOUT STATE OF SOCIAL. BLURB ABOUT STATE OF ECONOMICS. Within the clean cookstove industry, technical investigations focus primarily on understanding how to improve biomass combustion products and thermal efficiencies of cookstove technology.Research groups around the globe have contributed to the library of engineering evaluations of existing cookstoves by sharing model details and results of computational simulations. Many existing computational models, however, draw physical conclusions based on individual cookstove configurations leaving a vacancy in understanding for numerous different cookstove designs. The impact of producing a computational model of a biomass cookstove could be greatly improved by allowing designers to simulate a variety of cookstove configurations by way of a user-friendly open source software package.   Many (ALL MAYBE?) existing 

The intent of this paper is, first, to provide a review of existing computational modelling and software development efforts within the cookstove industry. Additionally, the paper presents version 1 (LC COME BACK HERE-is it v 1?) of the StoveOpt (LC MAKE SURE CITATIONS ARE SOLID WHEN REFERRING TO OWN SOFTWARE) software package; an open source biomass cookstove computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulator with built in optimimzation functionality. Specifically, the paper will discuss on the methodoly used in the CFD simulations and the implementation of the software (design, layout, functionality, etc.). The paper will share results from a preliminary case, draw conclusions about the package, and establish future work.

\section{Methodolgy}
%% PUT IN SUBSECTIONS FOR CFD, optimization, etc
%% In CFD discuss the models used, grid convergence (if I complete it), hardware and software used for simulations
The StoveOpt software package convert user-defined geometric parameters to create input files compatible with OpenFOAM version 6, an open-source CFD package commonly used by engineers and scientists within academia and various other industries (LIAM GO REFERENCE THE SOFTWARE FROM OPENFOAM MAIN PAGE). Analyzing results of simulations of the user-defined geometry at various secondary air flow bulk velocites automates the creation of new text based OpenFOAM input files via a simple optimization approach. Cases are created and analyzed in an iterative fashion until an optimal secondary air flow velocity is recovered from the design space. A detailed discussion of the full methodology is as follows.   

\subsection{Geometry}
The robust quality of the StoveOpt software is boasted by the abilty for a user to define any cookstove geometry, allowing for a potential interpretation and optimization of any stove design. The initial geometry definition is performed by editing a formatted Excel (REFERENCE EXCEL??) file existing within the \textit{stovegeom} folder within the StoveOpt directory. The specific parameters required to fully define the geometry are presented below in Figure 1 and Table 1 (LEE FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO FIGURES BETTER).

		  \hline
		   Parameter & Variable Designation \\ [0.5ex]

		      2 & Combustion chamber height & h_{c} \\
		       3 & Secondary inlet height & h_{FD} \\
			4 & Secondary inlet diameter & d_{FD} \\
			 5 & Channel width & w_{ch} \\ [1ex] 
			  6 & Channel height & h_{ch} \\ [1ex]
			   7 & Cone deck length & l_{cd} \\ [1ex]
			    8 & Pot spacing & p_[sp} \\ [1ex]
			  \hline
			   \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Mesh}
All mesh details for OpenFOAM CFD simulations are defined in the \textit{blockMeshDict} file within the \textit{system} folder of a case directory. OpenFOAM meshes are created by defining hexehedral blocks within using vertice definitions. The StoveOpt backend uses the user-defined geometry to create within the domain. The vertices written to the \textit{blockMeshDict} file are used to create the various blocks of the cookstove model.

To validate the default level of mesh refinement, grid convergence studies are underway for the test case discussed in next sections.   (LIAM REVISIT THIS AND POTENTIALLY DO THE ACTUAL GCI)

\subsection{Physical Models}
The study calls on an existing OpenFOAM solver called \textit{reactingFoam}, a transient CFD solver that includes combustion chemisty, heat transfer for a compressible fluid flow. The various methods used to model the flow physics are as follows; note, the following information was obtained directly from the OpenFOAM API guide (v1812) (LIAM GO GET A LINK).

LIAM PUT THE GENERAL DISCRETIZED EQUATION RIGHT HERE. CAN MAKE IT GAUSS, OR VOLUMETRIC HOWEVER WANTED.

The reacting flow is assumed to be laminar throughout the computational domain. This was chosen to limit the complexity and runtime of the first attempts of the software.

The thermophysical model used to describe heat transfer due to the reaction is called \textit{psiReactionThermo}, which is a model for a reacting mixture based on the compressibility of the mixture, $\Psi$, given by:

\[$\Psi$ = (RT)^-1\] 

Where R is gas constant, and T is the temperature of the mixture. This thermophysical model serves as the basis for many of the OpenFOAM combustion solvers. The mixture is assumed to behave as an ideal gas. The transport model used is based on Sutherland's law, which computes dynamic viscosity, $\mu$, based on the absolute temperature of a mixture T, the Sutherland coefficient $A_{s}$, and Sutherland Temperature $T_{s}$. 
\[$\mu$ = (A_{s}\sqrt{T})/(1 + T_{s}/T)\]

For the purposes of this work, Sutherland coefficient and Sutherland temperature were assigned values of$1.67x10^{-6}$ and $170.67 K$ for each specie in the mixture. Specific heat capacity, $c_{p}$ was computed as a function of temperature T, based on sets of coefficients from NIST JANAF tables for each of the species included (LC REFERENCE HERE). 

\[c_{p} = R((((a_{4}T + a_{3})T + a_{2})T + a_{1})T+ a_{0})\]

Chemistry is modelled using backward (implicit) Euler method. The method was chosen to maintain stability for the stiff problem. (LC MORE DEVELOPMENT NEEDED HERE) The combustion process is assumed to be laminar for the full course of the simulation (LC MORE DEVELOPMENT NEEDED HERE).


\subsection{Temporal Schemes}
The solver uses the first order implicit Euler method for moving forward in time, 

\[(\partial(\phi))/(\partial(t)) = (\phi - \phi^{o})/(\triangle(t))\]

Where $\phi$ represents the variable from the general transport equation, $\triangle$(t) is the time time step, and $\phi^{o}$ is the general transport variable value from the previous time step.

\subsection{Spatial Schemes}

In order to approximate cell-based quantities at cell interfaces, a variety of spatial interpolation schemes were used. Gradients terms within the general transport equation were evaluated using second order central differencing (LC MAKE AN EQUATION FROM THE CFD BOOK PROBABLY). For example, the approximations for gradients of $\phi_{P}$ with neighbors $\phi_{E}$, $\phi_{W}$, $\phi_{N}$, and $\phi_{S}$ would be represented as,

\[\nabla(\phi_{P}) = (\phi_{E} - \phi_{W})/(\triangle(x)) + (\phi_{N} - \phi_{S})/(\triangle(y)\]


Where $\triangle$x and $\triangle$y are grid spacing in x-coordinate and y-coordinate directions, respectively.

Divergence terms from the general transport equation are approximated using OpenFOAM's \textit{limitedLinear}, which uses a bounded second order central differencing method (LC MIGHT NEED TO ADD MORE HERE LATER ON). 

The Laplacian terms, similar to the gradient terms, are approximated using second order central differencing of the form:

\[\nabla^{2}(\phi_{P}) = (\phi_{E}-2\phi_{P} + phi_{W})/($\triangle$x^{2}) + (\phi_{N}-2\phi_{P} + \phi_{S})/($\triangle$y^{2}$)\]
